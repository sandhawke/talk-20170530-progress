Goal:

Tip the balance against
social software lock-in

---

Why? Three Examples

- personal health data in silos
- political activism (journalism) controlled by silo providers
- resource sharing markets (eg uber) in heavily capitalized battle

---

Funding in 2017

- ~0.6 FTE (remainder W3C Member Funding + OpenSocial)
- National Science Foundation (crosscloud via w3c)
- Knight Foundation (crosscloud for journalism)

---

2017 Deliverables (High Level)

- "bootstrap crosscloud ecosystem"
- show solid evidence of adoption
- ... toward clear social benefit

(_not publications_)

---

Thoughts on Funding in 2018

- based on success in 2017 (proof points)
- Likely goals:
    - civility and truth, online
    - healthy communities
    - ...?
- domains: journalism, science, health, marketing

---

Funding Landscape

- Industrial:  W3C membership, W3C BGs, Media Lab
    - Intermediated Content Providers
- Journalism: Knight, MacArthur, Omidyar
- Science: NSF, Sloan
- Health: NIH

The Adoption Problem

Why Do Decentralization Systems Keep "Failing"?

(ie not going mainstream)

* Motivations
    - Business Model, Politics
* UX

---

- Low-Crypto
    - Diaspora* / Friendica / Hubzilla (15k mau)
    - status.net / gnustatus / postActive
    - IndieWebCamp
    - [24 others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_software_and_protocols_for_distributed_social_networking)
- High-Crypto
    - IPFS
    - MaidSafe
    - Scuttlebutt
    - [14+ others](https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/#other_projects)

---

My Conclusions

1. the tech is too complicated (for mass adoption)
2. weak user value proposition (for mass adoption)
3. weak site admin motivation (for mass adoption)
4. lack of decentralized extensibility
    - only core team gets to have fun as coders
    - no room for 3rd party apps / vendors

All important, but extra focus on #4

---

"Trusty"

1. simple-ish tech (refining cyan)
2. user value: non-fake news, real knowledge
3. admin motive: commercial
4. dist-extn via template sentences (language-as-a-format)

---

Trusty: Flagship

<i>Friends helping friends understand the news</i>

Communicate via Agreement with Claims

and meta claims

---

Mastodon


---

Mastodon Issues

1. Bridging
2. Abuse, "Abuse"
3. Ecosystem
    - pledge, faq, white-label
4. Site Lock-In
    - http forwarding
5. Groups =?= Sites

---

More Mastodon Issues

6. Socially-Acceptable Search (Context Collapse)
7. Algorithmic Feeds: Too Much/Little Content
9. In-Page Social Features // silo ecosystem
8. Apps: github, facebook, instodon,
    - games, resource sharing, health info
10. Interop for forks

---

feed.studio

* have multiple feeds (gardens)
* tend each feed, or let it grow organically
* some control over outbound flow

---

Possible MVP within Mastodon UI

* @bot to create feeds
* follow it
* @feed, react to feed to tweak it
* can be viral

---

* feed profile, posts themselves, hosted on custom instance
    - details on why selected
    - more feedback options
    - shareable away from Mastodon
